# Blu Markets — Canonical Design & Decision Log

This document is the authoritative record of decisions and locked assumptions.

## Key Decisions
- Portfolio-first, not trading-first
- Rial-only flows
- Three-layer allocation (Foundation / Growth / Upside)
- Cash as first-class primitive
- Preview → Friction → Confirm → Commit
- Decision Boundary Layer (SAFE / DRIFT / STRUCTURAL / STRESS)
- Visible Stress Mode for demos

## Rejected Paths
- Competing with exchanges
- Pro trading UI
- Auto-invest without consent
- AI-driven opaque advice

## Current Locked Version
v7.6 — logic stable, UX minimal, scope controlled.
