# Blu Markets — Questionnaire Guidelines & Objective

## 1. Objective

The questionnaire exists for **one purpose only**:

> **To define a defensible, initial target allocation across the three portfolio layers:**
> **Foundation / Growth / Upside**

It is the **structural anchor** of the entire Blu Markets system.

The questionnaire does **not**:
- predict performance
- assess financial knowledge
- judge the user
- remove user agency
- optimize returns

Once set, every action in Blu Markets is evaluated **relative to this anchor**.

## 2. What the Questionnaire Is Allowed to Measure

The questionnaire may measure **only factors that directly affect portfolio structure**:

- **Income stability**  
  (predictability, not absolute income)

- **Financial resilience**  
  (how long the user can tolerate stress without needing the money)

- **Loss tolerance**  
  (emotional response to losses, not abstract risk appetite)

- **Time horizon**  
  (when capital may realistically be needed)

- **Behavior under volatility**  
  (what the user *actually does*, not what they believe is correct)

It must never ask about:
- investment knowledge
- expected returns
- market opinions
- “aggressive vs conservative” labels

---

## 3. Language & Tone (Non‑Negotiable)

- **Persian (Farsi) only**
- Everyday, conversational language
- No financial or technical jargon
- No abstract concepts (percentages, volatility, diversification)
- No judgmental phrasing

If an average user might ask *«یعنی چی؟»*, the wording is wrong.

## 4. Question Design Rules

### Number of Questions
- **7–9 questions total**
- Designed to complete in **~60 seconds**

### Answer Format
- Multiple choice only
- 3–5 options per question
- Options describe **real situations**, not attitudes

Good framing:
> «اگر برای مدتی ارزش دارایی‌تون کم بشه، معمولاً چه کاری می‌کنید؟»

Bad framing:
> «ریسک‌پذیری شما چقدر است؟»

---

## 5. Behavioral Framing (Critical)

Questions must be framed to capture:
- **revealed behavior**
- **realistic reactions**
- **lived experience**

They must avoid:
- “what should you do”
- “what experts say”
- aspirational answers

Assumption:
> **Users already know the ‘right’ answers and will lie if asked directly.**

So the questionnaire asks **sideways**.

---

## 6. Scoring Philosophy (Internal Only)

- No visible scores
- No numeric ratings
- No user labels

Internally:
- Each answer deterministically increases or decreases:
  - Foundation
  - Growth
  - Upside

The output is **structural**, not psychological.

---

## 7. Output Rules (What the User Sees)

After completion, the user sees:

- A three‑layer allocation (Foundation / Growth / Upside)
- A short, plain‑language explanation
- Explicit consent text (locked):

> **«متوجه ریسک این سبد دارایی شدم و باهاش موافق هستم.»**

No:
- “recommended for you”
- “AI‑powered optimization”
- “best portfolio” claims

This reinforces **ownership**, not authority.

---

## 8. Stability of the Result

- The target allocation is **sticky**
- It does not auto‑adjust based on behavior
- It changes only if:
  - the user explicitly retakes the questionnaire
  - or manually updates preferences later

This prevents silent drift and retroactive justification.

---

## 9. Relationship to the Product

The questionnaire:
- defines the **target**
- all actions operate relative to it
- drift is measured against it
- Decision Boundaries reference it

If the anchor is weak, the entire system becomes incoherent.

---

## One‑Sentence Litmus Test

> **If the user ignores all guidance after onboarding, Blu Markets should still remain structurally coherent.**

That is the standard this questionnaire must meet.
